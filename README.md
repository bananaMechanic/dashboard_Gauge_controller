# dashboard_Gauge_controller
Developed for General Motors LS swap projects.  Communicate with VPW ECM using ELM327 to collect engine data, and use that information to drive conventional analog gauges on an old-school dashboard.  Also monitors AC state and controls PWM radiator fan.

I am a total newbie.  This project is my first experiment with arduino, ESP-32, C++, OBD2 syntax, the GM VPW protocol, MOSFET operation, logic circuit design, any of it.  This represents about a year of on and off teaching myself from zero.  I tried to consider other total newbies during development: the code is very heavily commented, some of it is an instruction manual and some of it is just extraneous explanation, explaining "what this does" to someone like me.
